# Running Trial-specific LLMs Locally

This repository contains details, code, and sample data to help you learn how to build clinical trial-specific [Large Language Models ("LLM")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). 
Then you will be able to run the LLM in your local computer.

This work is done in collaboration with [Jan Philip Göpfert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jangop/)



## PHUSE SDE presentation, May 30 2024.

"Clinical trial-specific LLM to auto-generate Protocols and SAPs." ("SAP" standa for Staatistical Analysis Plan).
Here's the full [presentation file](./TrialTwin_06.pdf) for download.

"TrialTwin is building a software platform with Natural Language Generation (“NLG”) capabilities using Natural Language Processing (“NLP”) and other software-driven linguistic processors. Our platform will programmatically extract (and encode) both meaning and context from massive amounts of Open Data into a Domain-specific Large Language Model (“LLM”). Our LLM will then be able to programmatically generate highly-realistic and domain- specific new content.
Build your own trial-specific LLM, here are the pieces."


## Sample Data



### ClinicalTrials.gov

The [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website


The file ClinicalTrials_gov_10_PDFs.zip contains 10 PDFs downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov

And the file ClinicalTrials_gov_10_PDFs__index.zip contains the pre-generated indices for the 10 PDFs.
